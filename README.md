# EastmanLamPark_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject

## Summary
We are using this repository to upload data from NOAA's Tides & Currents Datasets for sea level measurements and NOAA's National Data Buoy Center for water temperature measurements. We are looking at monthly data for water temperature and sea level at three different coastal sites: Beaufort Marine Lab, Hatteras Island, and Wrightsville Beach. Sea level and water temperature were the chosen parameters to assess because they are indicators of climate change, and we want to analyze the changes occuring on the coast of North Carolina due to climate change. The data begins on the first day of 2011 and ends on November 31, 2022. This project will use a time series analysis to identify seasonal trends and changes in sea level and water temperature over the past 12 years using a Mann Kendall test. We will then identify if there is a statistical relationship between the two parameters using a Kendall correlation test.

## Database Information
Data from NOAA's Tides and Currents Database was accessed on November 20, 2022. The data acquired from the website includes monthly sea level data from Beaufort Marine Lab, Hatteras Island, and Wrightsville Beach from their earliest recorded data April 27, 2010 to November 30, 2022. The water temperature data was collected every 6 minutes by NOAA and we acquired this data from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center on December 1, 2022. The water temperature data dates back to January 1, 2011. We wrangled the data to average the sea level and water temperature measurements from NOAA for each month from 2011 to 2022 in order to create dataframes with identical periods of measurements for the analyses.

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 
This repository contains a code folder containing the code developed in R studio to complete the analysis, an output folder with final plots and computed statistics from analyses, a Raw_Data folder with the raw datasets downloaded from NOAA, and a Processed_Data folder with the raw data wrangled for monthly average values (excluding N/As). All of the raw and processed data are in csv format, the code files are RMDs, and the outputs will be jpg. We use "_" to dictate a space in a folder name and include the type of data, either sea level or water temperature. We also include the station name or if the data contains measurements from all stations we label the file as combined. In the Project_Instructions folder, we compiled all written guidance and templates for our reference created by the instructors of our Environmental Data Analysis course at Duke University, Dr. John Fay and Dr. Luana Lima.

## Metadata


<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.> 

## Scripts and code
In the code folder, we began the project by using the Wrangling_Data file to process the data to be in monthly format for sea level rise and water temperature data acquired from NOAA beginning in 2011. We then created the Data_Exploration rmd file to begin graphing the data and looking at trends over the years in sea level rise and water temperature fluctuations. We used the Data_Analysis rmd file to import our processed data frames and complete time series analysis, graphical representations, and a correlation test between the two variables. Finally, we used the Final_Project_Climate_Change_Analysis rmd file to organize the three different rmd files previously listed into one replicable code.
