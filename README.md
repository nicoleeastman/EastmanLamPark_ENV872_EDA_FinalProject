# EastmanLamPark_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject

## Summary
We are using this repository to upload data from NOAA's Tides & Currents Datasets. We are looking at monthly data for water temperature and sea level at three different coastal sites: Beaufort Marine Lab, Hatteras Island, and Wrightsville Beach. Sea level and water temperature were the chosen parameters to assess because they are indicators of climate change, and we want to analyze the impacts of climate change on the coast of North Carolina. The data begins in the first day of 2010 and ends on November 31, 2022. This project will use a time series analysis to identify seasonal trends and changes in sea level and water temperature over the past 12 years. We will then identify if there is a statistical relationship between the two parameters using a Mann-Kendall test.

## Database Information
Data from NOAA's Tides and Currents Database was accessed on November 20, 2022. The data acquired from the website includes monthly sea level data and daily water temperature at the following sites: Beaufort Marine Lab, Hatteras Island, and Wrightsville Beach from their earliest recorded data April 27, 2010 to November 30, 2022.
We processed the data to average the sea level and water temperature measurements from NOAA for each month from 2010 to 2022.

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>


## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 
This repository contains a code folder containing the code developed in R studio to complete the analysis, an output folder with final plots and computed statistics from analyses, a Raw_Data folder with the raw datasets downloaded from NOAA, and a Processed_Data folder with the raw data wrangled for monthly average values (excluding N/As). All of the raw and processed data are in csv format, the code will be an RMD, and the outputs will be jpg. We use "_" to dictate a space in a folder name and we capitalized each word.
